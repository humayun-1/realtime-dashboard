## Getting Started
This is a next js (15.1.3) application of realtime data tracking.

First, run the development server:

npm run start:all

It will run socket and json-server and the next server all at once. You can also run these commands on diff terminals if start:all doesn't work.

- npm run json-server
- npm run socket
- npm run dev
